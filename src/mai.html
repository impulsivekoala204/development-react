            <p class = "description">
                For this project, I had to redesign a website based on UX issues that I came across and I decided to pick the YC Hacker News website.
                This website is an excellent source of rich tech news compiled from multiple different sources but the design is still the same as it was years ago.
                There are several issues ranging from readibility to hierarchy which is why I decided to pick this website.

            <div class = img-block id = "l1">
                <img src = "hn.png" class = "diagram block-pic">
            </div>
            <br/>
            <h2 class = "small-head" id = "l2">PROBLEMS</h2>
            <ul class = "list-one">
                <li>Readibility Issues [Headlines, Functionality below Headline]</li>
                <li>Poor size and color contrast between different text</li>
                <li>Logo and Header hierarchy unclear [logo looks the same as text]</li>
                <li>Element hierarcy unclear</li>
                <li>Number of upvotes is hard to find and immediately clear</li>
                <li>Hard to find source</li>
                <li>The two core CTAs(calls to action) which are Hide and Comment are not clear</li>
                <li>The search bar is at the bottom of the page</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class = "small-head" id = "l3">ACCESSIBILITY</h2>
            From WAIVE, I agreed with the result that the text is too small at several places which makes it hard to read. WAIVE also showed poor heading and element structure which I also agreed with. Lastly WAIVE showed a lot of contrast errors with the colors as well which I thought were valid because of the poor hierarchy which makes the elements very hard to read or even distinguish properly.</li>
            <h2 class = "small-head" id = "l4">LOW-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h2>
            <p>I sketched out some low-fi prototypes to visualize a better interface.</p>
            <img src = "b1.png" style = "width:60vw"><br/>
            <img src = "b2.png" style = "width:15vw;padding-left:10vw;">
            <img src = "b3.png" style = "width:15vw;padding-left:10vw;">
            <h2 class = "small-head" id = "l5">HIGH-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h2>
            <p>I created the following high-fi prototypes from the lo-fi ones</p>
            <div class = "emap-block">
                <img src = "sg.png" style = "width:50vw;" class = "emap-one">
                <img src = "ds.png" style = "width:50vw;" class = "emap-one">
                <img src = "ts.png" style = "width:50vw;" class = "emap-one">
                <img src = "ms.png" style = "width:15vw;padding-left:4vw;" class = "emap-one">
            </div>
            <h2 class = "small-head" id = "#l6">WEBSITES</h2><br/>
            <p>Once I did all this, I was able to code up a Responsive redesign of the YC Hacker News website (Live <a href = "https://impulsivekoala204.github.io/Responsive-Redesign/">Here</a>)</p>
